Conserving Disk Space
*********************

Conserving Disk Space During Builds
===================================

To help conserve disk space during builds, you can add the following
statement to your project's ``local.conf`` configuration file found in
the :term:`Build Directory`::

   INHERIT += "rm_work"

Adding this statement deletes the work directory used for
building a recipe once the recipe is built. For more information on
"rm_work", see the
:ref:`rm_work <ref-classes-rm-work>` class in the
Yocto Project Reference Manual.

Purging Duplicate Shared State Cache Files
==========================================

After multiple build iterations, the Shared State (sstate) cache can contain
duplicate cache files for a given package, while only the most recent one
is likely to be reusable. The following command purges all but the
newest sstate cache file for each package::

   sstate-cache-management.sh --remove-duplicated --cache-dir=build/sstate-cache

This command will ask you to confirm the deletions it identifies.

.. note::

   The duplicated sstate cache files of one package must have the same
   architecture, which means that sstate cache files with multiple
   architectures are not considered as duplicate.

Run ``sstate-cache-management.sh`` for more details about this script.
