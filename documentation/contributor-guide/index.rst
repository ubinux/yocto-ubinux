Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded Contributor Guide
================================================

The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded are open-source, community-based projects so
contributions are very welcome, it is how the code evolves and everyone can
effect change. Contributions take different forms, if you have a fix for an
issue you’ve run into, a patch is the most appropriate way to contribute it.
If you run into an issue but don’t have a solution, opening a defect in
:yocto_bugs:`Bugzilla <>` or asking questions on the mailing lists might be
more appropriate. This guide intends to point you in the right direction to
this.
