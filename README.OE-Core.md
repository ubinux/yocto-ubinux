OpenEmbedded-Core
=================

OpenEmbedded-Core is a layer containing the core metadata for current versions
of OpenEmbedded. It is distro-less (can build a functional image with
DISTRO = "nodistro") and contains only emulated machine support.

The Yocto Project has extensive documentation about OE including a reference manual
