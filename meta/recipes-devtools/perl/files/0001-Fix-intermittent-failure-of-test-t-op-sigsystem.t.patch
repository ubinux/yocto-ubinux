Subject: [PATCH] Fix intermittent failure of test t/op/sigsystem.t

[Perl issue #21546] -- https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21546

This fix addresses the intermittent failure of the test
t/op/sigsystem.t by improving its robustness. Before the fix, this
test waits a hard-coded amount of time in the parent process for the
child process to exit, and the child process may not be able to exit
soon enough. With this fix, the parent process in this test polls for
whether the SIGCHLD handler reaped the child process for at most 25
seconds.
