SUMMARY = "Test::Warnings - Test for warnings and the lack of them"
DESCRIPTION = "If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no \
warnings generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of \
\\"done_testing\\" to not have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered \
that these two features do not play well together, as the test count will \
be calculated *before* the warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error. \
(See "examples/test_nowarnings.pl" in this distribution for a \
demonstration.)"
