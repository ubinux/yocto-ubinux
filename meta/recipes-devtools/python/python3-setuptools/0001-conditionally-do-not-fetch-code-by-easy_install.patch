Subject: [PATCH] conditionally do not fetch code by easy_install

If NO_FETCH_BUILD is set, do not fetch code in easy_install. This avoids setup.py
trying to fetch missing dependencies at build time.

This is only used by the deprecated codepath as implemented by setuptools3.bbclass, so
when that ever gets removed this patch can also be deleted.
