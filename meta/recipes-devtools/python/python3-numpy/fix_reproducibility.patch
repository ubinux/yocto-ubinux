Subject: [PATCH] This regex decides whether to use O3 opimisation on numpy or
 not.

It includes "od", which happens to be a substring of "reproducible"
but not "qemux86-world".

The regex will run against all compiler options including things like:

-fmacro-prefix-map=/XXX/build/tmp/work/core2-64-poky-linux/python3-numpy/1.26.0/numpy-1.26.0=/usr/src/debug/python3-numpy/1.26.0-r0

i.e. including build paths.

Reduce the regex to something deterministic for our builds, assuming
nobody builds in /home/debug:full/

The autobuilder race depended upon whether qemux86-world or the
reproducible target ran first and won the race to populate sstate.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [upstream have dropped distutils and switched to meson]
