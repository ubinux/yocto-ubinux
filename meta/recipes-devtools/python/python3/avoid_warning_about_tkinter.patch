Subject: [PATCH] _tkinter module needs tk module along with tcl. tk is not yet
 integrated in yocto so we skip the check for this module. Avoid a warning by
 not adding this module to missing variable.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [distribution]

Also simply disable the tk module since its not in DEPENDS.
