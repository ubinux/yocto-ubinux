Subject: [PATCH] python3: Ensure stale empty python module directories don't

There are two issues here. Firstly, the modules are accessed in on disk order. This
means behaviour seen on one system might not reproduce on another and is a real headache.

Secondly, empty directories left behind by previous modules might be looked at. This
has caused a long string of different issues for us.

As a result, patch this to a behaviour which works for us.

Upstream-Status: Pending [need to talk to upstream to see if they'll take one or both fixes]
