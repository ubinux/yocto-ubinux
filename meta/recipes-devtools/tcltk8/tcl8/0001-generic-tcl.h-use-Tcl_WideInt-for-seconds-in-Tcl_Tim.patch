Subject: [PATCH] generic/tcl.h: use Tcl_WideInt for seconds in Tcl_Time

This ensures the value will not overflow, particularly on 32 bit systems
in 2038, where long will.

This patch was proposed at https://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl/tktview/86dd172271
Upstream was generally supportive of the fix, but they merged a much more
elaborate version of it for tcl 9.x (released in 9.0.0), and declined
to merge it into 8.x due to ABI breakage (sadly this change is in a public header).
But we can carry the fix downstream.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [see above]
