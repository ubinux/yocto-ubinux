Subject: [PATCH] rsync: Fix a file sorting determinism issue

The Makefile calls awk on a "*.c" glob. The results of this glob are sorted
but the order depends on the locale settings, particularly whether
"util.c" and "util2.c" sort before or after each other. In en_US.UTF-8
they sort one way, in C, they sort the other. The sorting order changes
the output binaries. The behaviour also changes dependning on whether
SHELL (/bin/sh) is dash or bash.

Specify a C locale setting to be deterministic.

Upstream-Status: Backport [ish, see below]

After discussion upstream renamed util.c to util1.c which avoids the problem
in a different way. This patch can be dropped when we upgrade to include:
