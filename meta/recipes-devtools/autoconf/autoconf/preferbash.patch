Subject: [PATCH] m4sh: prefer bash over sh

_AS_DETECT_BETTER_SHELL looks for a good shell to use, and tries to look for
'sh' before 'bash'.  Whilst for many systems sh is a symlink to bash,
there are many where sh is a symlink to a more minimal sh implementation.

For example, Debian by default has /bin/sh -> /bin/dash: dash is a faster
shell to start (which makes a notable difference to boot speed) but is not
as fast as bash at executing long scripts (and configure scripts are not
known for their conciseness).

Change the search order to bash then sh, so that a known-good shell (bash)
is used if available over something which is merely POSIX compliant.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe specific]
