        SPDX_IMPORTS_<key>_uri: The URI where the SPDX Document that contains \
            the external object can be found. Optional but recommended \

# Agents
#   Bitbake variables can be used to describe an SPDX Agent that may be used
#   during the build. An Agent is specified using a set of variables which all
#   start with some common base name:
#
#   <BASE>_name: The name of the Agent (required)
#   <BASE>_type: The type of Agent. Must be one of "person", "organization",
#       "software", or "agent" (the default if not specified)
#   <BASE>_comment: The comment for the Agent (optional)
#   <BASE>_id_<ID>: And External Identifier for the Agent. <ID> must be a valid
#       ExternalIdentifierType from the SPDX 3 spec. Commonly, an E-mail address
#       can be specified with <BASE>_id_email
#
#   Alternatively, an Agent can be an external reference by referencing a key
#   in SPDX_IMPORTS like so:
#
#   <BASE>_import = "<key>"
#
#   Finally, the same agent described by another set of agent variables can be
#   referenced by specifying the basename of the variable that should be
#   referenced:
