Subject: [PATCH] bash: update 5.0 -> 5.1

Including m4 files directly like this confuses autotools.bbclass, remove
the references and rely upon aclocal to collect the m4 files together
as needed instead making it work like other autotools based projects.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [OE configuration specific]
