Subject: [PATCH] gio/tests/g-file-info: don't assume million-in-one events

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/2990]
Signed-off-by: Ross Burton <ross.burton@arm.com>

 don't happen

The access and creation time tests create a file, gets the time in
seconds, then gets the time in microseconds and assumes that the
difference between the two has to be above 0.

As rare as this may be, it can happen:

$ stat g-file-info-test-50A450 -c %y
2021-07-06 18:24:56.000000767 +0100

Change the test to simply assert that the difference not negative to
handle this case.

This is the same fix as 289f8b, but that was just modification time.
