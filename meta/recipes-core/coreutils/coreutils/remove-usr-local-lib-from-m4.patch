Subject: [PATCH] coreutils: Fix build on uclibc

We have problem using hardcoded directories like /usr/local here
which will be checked for cross builds. This is a special case which
is valid for AIX only. We do not have AIX as one of our supported
build host or target. Therefore we get rid of the hardcoded paths
and make life easier for cross compilation process.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [Upstream does care for AIX while we may not]
