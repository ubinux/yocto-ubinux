Subject: [PATCH] Skip running test-layout test

This fails intermittently, it varies based on what version of harfbuzz
is installed and if it does not match with what pango CI tests then we
get random failures in this test. This has been disabled in other
distros [1] too

We want to drop this on next upgrade and see if this test passes if not
then keep it disabled

Fixes

Running test: pango/test-layout.test
1..36
ok 1 /layout/letterspacing.layout
ok 2 /layout/valid-7.layout
not ok 3 /layout/valid-14.layout
Bail out!
