Subject: [PATCH] scripts/CMakeLists.txt: append to CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH
 instead of replacing it

Resetting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH in particular breaks builds in Yocto
(which is a major cross compiling framework).

Upstream-Status: Backport [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/commit/e1b11dc7856765cf45a283ac805ea5066c81cd9b]
