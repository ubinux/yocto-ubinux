Subject: [PATCH] ARM: qemu related workarounds in cpu features detection code
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This was ported from meta-oe's patch [1]. The original pixman patch is found
at [2].

+ * The whole CPU capabilities detection is a bit ugly: when running in
+ * userspace qemu, we see /proc/self/auxv from the host system. To make
+ * everything even worse, the size of each value is 64-bit when running
+ * on a 64-bit host system. So the data is totally bogus because we expect
+ * 32-bit values. As AT_PLATFORM value is used as a pointer, it may cause
+ * segfault (null pointer dereference on x86-64 host). So in order to be
+ * on a safe side, we require that AT_PLATFORM value is found only once,
+ * and it has non-zero value (this is still not totally reliable for a big
+ * endian 64-bit host system running qemu and may theoretically fail).
