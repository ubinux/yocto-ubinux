# To simulate Y2038 occurring in qemu, add to your build configuration:

#
# Note that this does result in ptest failures on qemux86:
# perl python3 dbus openssl glibc-tests openssh curl glib-2.0 tcl libmodule-build-perl
# and a subset of those occurs in qemux86-64 as well:
# curl python3 openssl openssl tcl python3-cryptography
#
# Working to address those (before Y2038 rolls in) will be appreciated.
